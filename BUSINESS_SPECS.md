# DreamVersion - Business Specifications & Sitemap

## Company Overview
DreamVersion is an industrial technology company with two core areas of focus: integration services and proprietary software products. On the integration side, DreamVersion designs and delivers automation and digital transformation solutions for industrial clients across North America. The team leads full-scope deployments spanning control systems, SCADA, MES, and data infrastructure, with a focus on reliability, maintainability, and long-term business value.

DreamVersion engineers are deeply experienced with leading industrial platforms including Rockwell Automation (PlantPAx, FactoryTalk View ME and SE, Logix), Siemens (TIA Portal, WinCC), Inductive Automation (Ignition), and Cognex for machine vision. This technical foundation allows the company to work across a wide variety of manufacturing environments, from greenfield deployments to brownfield retrofits, regardless of industry or application.

The company’s software division develops and maintains AI, PI, and CSI, three proprietary platforms designed to uncover business opportunities through smarter use of operational and enterprise data. These tools are built from direct experience in the field and aim to close the gap between insight and action for manufacturing decision-makers.

DreamVersion serves clients in virtually every major industrial sector, including food and beverage, life sciences, consumer packaged goods, automotive, energy, packaging, specialty chemicals, and more. Whether implementing plant-floor systems or enabling enterprise visibility through software, DreamVersion brings technical depth and operational clarity to every engagement.
